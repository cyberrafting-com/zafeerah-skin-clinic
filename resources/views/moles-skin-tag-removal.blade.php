                                    Moles and skin tags are common skin growths that many people experience at some point in
                                    their lives. While they are usually harmless, they can sometimes cause discomfort or
                                    self-consciousness, leading individuals to consider removal options.

                                <h5 class="service-title1 ">What Are Moles and Skin Tags?
                                </h5>
                                <p>Moles are groups of pigmented cells that are seen as small, dark spots on the skin. They
                                    may vary in size, shape, and color, ranging from tan to brown to black. Moles are
                                    typically harmless but should be monitored for changes in size, shape, or color, as
                                    these could indicate skin cancer.

                                </p>
                                <p>Skin tags, on the other hand, are small, soft growths that protrude from the skin. They
                                    are often flesh-colored or slightly darker and are connected to the skin by a thin
                                    stalk. Skin tags are benign and commonly occur in areas where the skin rubs against
                                    itself, such as the neck, underarms, or groin.
                                </p>

                                <h5 class="service-title1 sep">How the Removal Techniques Work
                                </h5>

                                <p class="text">Several techniques are available for removing moles and skin tags,
                                    including:
                                </p>
                                <ul class="service-ul sep">
                                    <li>
                                        <strong>Excision: </strong> This involves cutting the mole or skin tag off with a
                                        scalpel. Before the procedure, the area is typically numbed with a local anesthetic.
                                        Stitches may be required for larger moles or skin tags.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <strong>Cauterization:</strong> In this method, the mole or skin tag is burned off
                                        using a special tool that generates heat. Cauterization helps seal the wound,
                                        reducing the risk of bleeding and infection.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <strong>Cryotherapy:</strong> Cryotherapy involves freezing the mole or skin tag
                                        with liquid nitrogen. This causes the growth to blister and eventually fall off.
                                        Multiple sessions may be needed for complete removal.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <strong>Laser Therapy:</strong> Laser treatment uses focused light to target and
                                        destroy the cells in the mole or skin tag. It is a precise method that may require
                                        multiple sessions for optimal results.
                                    </li>

                                        <strong>Improved Appearance: </strong>Removing unsightly moles and skin tags can boost self-confidence and improve overall appearance, especially if the growths are in visible or sensitive areas.

                                        <strong>Relief from Discomfort:</strong> Skin tags that rub against clothing or jewellery can cause irritation and discomfort. Removing them can alleviate these issues.

                                        <strong>Early Detection of Abnormalities: </strong> Regularly monitoring moles for changes and having suspicious moles evaluated by a dermatologist during the removal process can aid in the early detection of skin cancer.

                                        <strong>Quick and Minimally Invasive: </strong> Many removal techniques are quick, outpatient procedures that require minimal recovery time, allowing patients to resume their daily activities shortly after treatment.
