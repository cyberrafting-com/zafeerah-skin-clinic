                            </h5>
                            <p>
                                Growth Factor Concentrate (GFC) for hair is a specialized formulation derived from the patient's own blood, containing a concentrated amount of growth factors and platelets. These concentrated growth factors play a crucial role in stimulating hair follicle activity, promoting hair regrowth, and improving hair quality. GFC for hair is a non-surgical treatment option that harnesses the body's natural healing mechanisms to address hair loss and thinning.

                            <h5 class="service-title1 ">Role of Growth Factor Concentrate for Hair</h5>
                            <p>Growth Factor Concentrate for hair serves several important roles in hair restoration:</p>

                                <li>
                                    <strong>Stimulating Hair Follicles:</strong> The growth factors in GFC stimulate dormant hair follicles, promoting the transition from the resting phase (telogen) to the active growth phase (anagen), leading to increased hair density and thickness.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Improving Blood Circulation:</strong> GFC improves blood circulation to the scalp, providing essential nutrients and oxygen to hair follicles.
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Reducing Hair Shedding:</strong> By strengthening hair follicles and improving their resilience, GFC can help reduce excessive hair shedding and improve overall hair retention.</li>
                                <li><strong>Enhancing Hair Quality:</strong> GFC can also improve the quality of existing hair by increasing its strength, elasticity, and vitality, leading to healthier and more resilient hair strands.</li>

                                    <strong>Blood Collection:</strong>A small quantity of the patient's blood, typically 30-60 millilitres, is drawn.
                                </li>
                                <li> <strong>Centrifugation:</strong> The blood sample is processed in a centrifuge to segregate the plasma rich in platelets and growth factors from other blood components.</li>
                                <li> <strong>Growth Factor Extraction:</strong> The concentrated plasma, rich in growth factors, is extracted and prepared as Growth Factor Concentrate for hair treatment.</li>
                                <li> <strong>Application:</strong> The Growth Factor Concentrate is then applied to the scalp, either through injections or topically, to target scalp areas of hair loss or thinning.</li>
