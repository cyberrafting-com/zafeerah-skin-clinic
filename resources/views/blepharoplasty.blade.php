                            <h5 class="service-title1 ">What is Blepharoplasty?

                            </h5>
                            <p>Blepharoplasty is a surgical procedure performed to enrich the appearance of the eyelids by removing all the unwanted skin, muscle, and fat. It can be performed on the upper eyelids, lower eyelids, or both, based on the patient's specific needs and goals. While Blepharoplasty is often sought for cosmetic reasons to achieve a more youthful and refreshed look, it also serves functional purposes such as improving vision in cases where drooping eyelids obstruct eyesight.

                            <p class="text">The role of Blepharoplasty extends beyond cosmetic enhancement. Here are some key roles of this procedure:
                            </p>
                            <ul class="service-ul sep">
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Cosmetic Enhancement::</strong>Blepharoplasty can effectively address common signs of aging around the eyes, like drooping eyelids, puffy bags, and fine lines, resulting in a more youthful and rested appearance.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Functional Improvement:</strong> For individuals with significant eyelid drooping (ptosis) that obstructs their vision, Blepharoplasty can help lift the eyelids, improving both aesthetics and eyesight.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Boost in Self-Confidence:</strong> Many patients experience a boost in self-esteem and confidence following Blepharoplasty, as the procedure can rejuvenate the eyes and overall facial appearance.
                                </li>

                                <li>
                                    <strong>Treatment of Under-Eye Bags:</strong> Lower eyelid blepharoplasty is particularly effective in addressing under-eye bags, reducing puffiness and creating a smoother contour.
                                </li>

                            </ul>

                                    <strong>Upper Eyelid Blepharoplasty: </strong>In this procedure, incisions or cuts are made along the natural creases of the upper eyelids to remove the unwanted skin, muscle, and fat. The remaining tissues are then meticulously repositioned and sutured, resulting in a rejuvenated upper eyelid contour.
                                </li>

                                    <strong>Lower Eyelid Blepharoplasty:</strong> For lower eyelid rejuvenation, incisions are typically made just below the lower lash line or inside the lower eyelid. Excess fat and skin are removed or repositioned to reduce puffiness and improve the lower eyelid's appearance.
                                </li>
