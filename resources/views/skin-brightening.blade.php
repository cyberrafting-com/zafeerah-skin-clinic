                                </h5>
                                <p>Skin brightening is a cosmetic technique designed to lighten and even out skin tone,
                                    reduce hyperpigmentation, and enhance overall radiance. It involves using products or
                                    treatments that target dark spots, age spots, sun damage, and dullness, resulting in a
                                    more luminous complexion. This technique is beneficial for individuals dealing with
                                    uneven skin tone, blemishes, or signs of aging.

                                <p class="text">The role of skin brightening in skincare is multifaceted. It addresses
                                    various skin concerns and contributes to a healthier, more vibrant complexion. Some key
                                    roles of skin brightening include:

                                        <strong>Evening Out Skin Tone:</strong> Skin brightening helps to fade dark spots,
                                        acne scars, and pigmentation irregularities, leading to a more uniform complexion.

                                        <strong>Reducing Hyperpigmentation:</strong> It targets excessive melanin
                                        production, which is responsible for dark patches or discoloration on the skin.

                                        <strong>Enhancing Radiance:</strong> By promoting skin cell turnover and collagen
                                        production, skin brightening techniques enhance skin's natural radiance and glow.

                                        <strong>Chemical Peels:</strong> Dermatologist-administered chemical peels exfoliate

                                        <strong>Laser Therapy: </strong> Laser treatments target melanin-rich areas,

                                        texture and tone.
