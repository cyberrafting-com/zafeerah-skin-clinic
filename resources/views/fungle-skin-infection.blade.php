                                Understanding Fungal Skin Infections


                            </h3>
                            <p class="text">Before delving into treatment and prevention methods, it's essential to understand what fungal skin infections are and how they develop. Fungal infections occur when fungi, such as dermatophytes or yeast, proliferate on the skin's surface or penetrate its deeper layers. These fungi thrive in warm, moist environments, making areas like the feet, groin, and underarms susceptible to infection. Common types of fungal skin infections include athlete's foot, jock itch, ringworm, and yeast infections.
