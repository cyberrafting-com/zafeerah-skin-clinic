                                </h5>

                                <p>HIFU stands for High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound. It's a therapeutic technology that uses focused ultrasound waves to target specific parts or tissues in the body. This focused ultrasound energy is capable of producing heat, which can then be used to treat various medical conditions.

                                </h5>

                                <p>HIFU has found applications in several medical fields, including oncology, urology, gynecology, and dermatology. Its primary role lies in its power to treat tumours and other diseased tissues without the need for invasive surgery. This makes it an attractive option for patients who are not suitable candidates for traditional surgery or who prefer non-invasive treatment methods.


                                </p>

                                      The HIFU procedure involves focusing high-intensity ultrasound waves on a specific target within the body.

                                    <li>
                                     These waves pass through the skin and other tissues without causing harm until they reach the focal point, where they converge to create intense heat. 
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                      This heat can destroy targeted tissue or trigger biological responses that help in treating the condition.
