                                </p>

                                    <strong>Scars:</strong> Appearance of depressed or raised areas on the skin, ranging from shallow pits to deeper craters. They often result from severe acne breakouts that damage the skin's collagen and tissue.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                      <strong>Hyperpigmentation: </strong> This condition causes dark patches or spots on the skin, typically occurring after inflammation or injury. Post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH) is common after acne lesions heal.

                                   <strong>Hypopigmentation:</strong> In contrast, hypopigmentation leads to lighter areas of skin due to a decrease in melanin production. It can also occur after skin trauma or certain treatments.

                                <p>Several factors contribute to the development of acne scars and pigmentation issues, including:
                                </p>

                                    <li><strong>Acne Breakouts:</strong> Prolonged or severe acne can lead to scarring and pigmentation changes, especially if the lesions are manipulated or picked.
                                   
                                    </li>
                                    <li> <strong>Genetics:</strong> Some people are more prone to developing scars or pigmentation problems due to genetic factors influencing skin healing and melanin production.
                                   
                                    </li>
                                    <li> <strong>Skin Type:</strong> People with darker skin tones (Fitzpatrick skin types IV-VI) are more susceptible to hyperpigmentation, while lighter skin tones may experience hypopigmentation.

                                     <li> <strong>Inflammatory Response:</strong> Excessive inflammation during acne flare-ups can disrupt melanin production, leading to pigmentation irregularities.

                                     <li> <strong>Improper Skincare:</strong> Using harsh skincare products or picking at acne lesions can exacerbate scarring and pigmentation issues.
