                            <p>Role of Eye Bag Correction
                                The eyes are one of the most prominent features of the face and play a crucial role in facial aesthetics. However, as we age, the skin around the eyes loses elasticity, and fat deposits may accumulate, leading to the formation of under-eye bags and sagging eyelids. These changes can make individuals appear tired, older, or even perpetually fatigued, impacting their overall facial harmony and self-esteem.
                            </p>
                            <p>Eye bag correction serves to address these concerns by:

                            <p class="text">The primary role of Laser Eye Wrinkle Reduction is to rejuvenate the eye area by addressing common signs of ageing, including:
                            </p>
                            <ul class="service-ul sep">

                                    <strong>Removing Excess Fat:</strong>The procedure involves the careful removal or repositioning of unwanted fat deposits beneath the eyes, reducing puffiness and creating a smoother contour.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Tightening Skin:</strong> Sagging or loose skin around the eyes is tightened and re-draped, leading to a more toned and rejuvenated appearance.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Restoring Youthful Eyes:</strong> By addressing under-eye bags and drooping eyelids, eye bag correction helps restore a more youthful, alert, and vibrant look to the eyes, enhancing overall facial aesthetics.

                            </h5>

                                    <strong>Consultation and Evaluation:</strong>The process begins with a thorough consultation with a board-certified plastic surgeon. During this consultation, the surgeon evaluates the patient's medical history, assesses the extent of under-eye bags or puffiness, discusses expectations, and outlines the surgical plan.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Anaesthesia:</strong> Eye bag correction surgery is typically performed under local anaesthesia or general anaesthesia, ensuring patient comfort throughout the procedure.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Incision Placement:</strong> The surgeon makes precise incisions along the natural creases of the eyelids or inside the lower eyelid, minimizing visible scarring.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Fat Removal and Skin Tightening:</strong> Excess fat is carefully removed or repositioned, and the underlying muscles may be tightened if necessary. The skin is then re-draped and trimmed to create a smoother, firmer appearance.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Closure:</strong> The incisions are securely closed with sutures or surgical adhesive, and sterile dressings are applied to facilitate healing.
                                </li>
