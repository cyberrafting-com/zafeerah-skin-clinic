                                       <strong> Topical Treatments:</strong> Creams, serums, or gels containing ingredients such as vitamin C, retinoids, hyaluronic acid, or peptides may be applied topically to lighten pigmentation, improve skin texture, and reduce puffiness.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <strong>Chemical Peels:</strong> Mild chemical peels with ingredients like glycolic acid, lactic acid, etc., can help exfoliate the skin, improve skin tone, and reduce pigmentation.

                                    <li>
                                       <strong>Filler Injections:</strong> Hyaluronic acid fillers may be injected under the eyes to fill hollow areas, reduce shadows, and improve skin elasticity, resulting in a smoother and more even appearance.

                                    <li>
                                      <strong>Laser Therapy:</strong> Laser treatments target melanin pigment and stimulate collagen production, leading to brighter and firmer skin around the eyes.

                                    <li>
                                    <strong>Microneedling:</strong> This technique involves using fine needles to create micro-injuries, triggering the skin's natural healing response and promoting collagen synthesis, which can improve skin texture and reduce pigmentation.
