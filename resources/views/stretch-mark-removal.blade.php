                                <p>Stretch marks are a type of scarring that occurs when the skin is stretched suddenly due
                                    to factors such as pregnancy, rapid weight gain or loss, puberty, or certain medical
                                    conditions. They often appear as red, purple, or white lines on the skin, and their
                                    texture may feel different from the surrounding skin.

                                        response and promoting collagen production. Microneedling can improve the texture
