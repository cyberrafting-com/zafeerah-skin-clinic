                                <p>Botox is a neurotoxic compound produced by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum. While
                                    this may sound alarming, Botox is used in minuscule amounts for medical and cosmetic
                                    purposes. It functions by temporarily paralyzing muscles or blocking nerves, leading to a
                                    reduction in wrinkles, fine lines, and various other conditions.

                                </p>

                                </h5>

                                <p class="text">The primary role of Botox in the cosmetic field is to diminish the appearance of facial
                                    wrinkles and lines, particularly those caused by repetitive muscle contractions. 
                                    Common areas treated with Botox include forehead lines, lines around the eyes, and frown
                                    lines between the eyebrows. Beyond aesthetics, Botox also has therapeutic applications, like
                                    treating migraines, muscle spasms, and excessive sweating.

                                        The technique behind Botox involves injecting small doses of the toxin into specific
                                        muscles or areas of concern.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        The toxin then blocks signals from the nerves to the muscles, preventing them from
                                        contracting fully.
                                    </li>

                                        <strong>Cryotherapy:</strong> Cryotherapy involves freezing the mole or skin tag
                                        with liquid nitrogen. This causes the growth to blister and eventually fall off.
                                        Multiple sessions may be needed for complete removal.

                                        This relaxed state of the muscles leads to smoother skin and a reduction in wrinkles over time.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>The procedure is typically quick, relatively painless, and does not require downtime,
