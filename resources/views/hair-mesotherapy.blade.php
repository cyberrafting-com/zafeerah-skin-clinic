                            </h5>
                            <p>
                            Mesotherapy is an invasive cosmetic procedure that involves injecting a combination of minerals, vitamins, amino acids, enzymes, and other active ingredients directly into the skin's mesodermal layer (middle layer). This targeted delivery of nutrients and bioactive substances aims to improve skin quality, stimulate collagen production, enhance blood circulation, and promote hair growth in the scalp.

                            </p>
                            <h5 class="service-title1 ">Role of Mesotherapy in Cosmetic Treatments</h5>
                            <p>Mesotherapy serves multiple purposes in the realm of cosmetic treatments, including:</p>

                                   Mesotherapy can rejuvenate the skin by improving hydration, elasticity, and firmness, reducing fine lines, wrinkles, and age spots, and enhancing overall skin tone and texture.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    For individuals experiencing hair loss or thinning, mesotherapy injections in the scalp can stimulate hair follicles, promote hair growth, and improve hair density.
